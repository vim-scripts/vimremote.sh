I wanted to use vim from the Xilinx ide, and I like the following actions to occur from the IDE


1) open every file in a split window in one gvim session
2) when opening the same file again from the IDE, don't cause a new split window if there is already one
3) use the line numbers provided by the ide.

In Xilinx you would define the external editor call 

/path/to/vimremote.sh XILINX $1 $2

The XILINX is just a name so that one particular gvim session is used for it, and not any others you might have hanging around

You need a decent shell. Don't know how that works in Windows. This script could be useful in many other ide's that allow calls to external editors
